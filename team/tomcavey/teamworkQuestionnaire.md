# Teamwork Questionnaire for _Tom Cavey_

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ENFP
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is best (408)482-3398. Phone calls second best. Any reasonable time.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect us to try our best, and strive to learn as much as we can.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * Constructing precise and clear communication is a personal goal of mine.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * The amount of collaborative time. If we can solidify time out of class to meet, I believe we will be successful in our goals.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Everybody should try their best. The team is only as strong as their weakest link, so if someone knows a better way to do something, we should work together to achieve our best grade possible.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Not really, the best way to get an A is to work together and have open communication. If someone notices theres more work to be done, we need to address it as a team. Work smart, not hard.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Not sure yet, I assume 5-10 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * When each activity that becomes assigned, we will plan it out. Defined roles will limit productivity and will enforce behaviors that are not team oriented.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We hope that this doesnt happen, but if it does- the rest of the team should acknowledge it, and the member should align with us of why things happened.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If this happens, we need to take a step back and look at the "WHY?". Why do these two opinions differ? What makes them similar? Find a resolution that works for both.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * This is the core of teamwork, everybody has different ways of doing things. Identifying them is the first step in working together.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 1-3 days a week maybe? Depends on the work load.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Not necessarily. If the decision impacts more than just the individual, we should need to seek approval.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Make a list of pros/cons. Have open communication on why. Everybody (including the majority) needs to be open in changing their minds.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Remind the team that we all have an equal say in the progression of the project. All opinions are always welcome.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Reach out to the team and ask for help!
