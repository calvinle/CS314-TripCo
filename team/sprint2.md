# Sprint 2 - 12 - Team Goslings

## Goal

To complete epics 33-39 and 42(in tripco directory) and to distingiush our web app through design

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: Joshua Henry

## Definition of Done

* Web application ready for demo and potential customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Complete all current issues in directory
* ~~Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.~~

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* 65 Show map of round trip
* 66 Give the user the option to choose if data is displayed in km or mi
* 68 Let the user save their trip
* 80 Show an itinerary of the round trip
* 83 Let the user load a file with destinations
* 84 Plan the trip in the order the user provided
* 91 Build a responsive, mobile first web application

*Only 1 previous sprint, our possibly low estimates are because that sprint went well. The current plan may be a bit optimistic, however we have learned a lot about how to do these projects and how to work in the tools and languages we have been given, which accounts for the optimism
