## Goal

### Worldwide and Extra User Customization!
### Sprint Leader: Calvin Le

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (kiwis.cs.colostate.edu).
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the archived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>5.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Tests for database and REST APIs.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

There will be an increase of discussions on ideas of executing parts of the sprint. The main benefit is to catch mistakes and hopefully find newer and better ideas. Since there is more of a focus on modifying and improving both the client and server side, members will be involved in more than one Epic.
