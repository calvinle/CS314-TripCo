5. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * It's important to learn that nothing should be taken personal, in the workplace and school. We're all here because we want to learn, and that's the most important part. We need to build eachother up!
6. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__

   * The person needs to acknowledge how it made the rest of the team feel, and align with the team. Then assure it wont happen again.
11. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__

15. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__
