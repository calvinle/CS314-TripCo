# Teamwork Questionnaire for Charlie Schoonover

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ENTP - The Inventor
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ ]]
   * I am best reached by phone (970) 227-6267, email wcschoonover@gmail.com, and Slack. Feel free to reach out to me any time and I'll get back to you ASAP.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that we complete each task quickly, accurately, and in a manner that surpasses expectations.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * In the past I typically have thrown myself at problems and tasks with little to no communication. I would like to keep up communication with teammates throughout development to keep everyone on the same page. I also want to work on committing smaller incremental changes to my code rather than my large code dumps in the past.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I'm taking a lot of credits this semester while working full time, so if I get behind, I could find myself focusing on just getting my tasks done and committing later, resulting in large code dumps. This could also result in a lack of communication between me and my team, so its imperative that I stay ahead of my responsibilities.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I would encourage teammates in the "B" category to work harder at the issues, and work to come together as a team to really excel.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * It is acceptable as long as they are the individuals to receive an "A".
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 7-10 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Depending on the task, either play to strengths, or (as long as communication is open) allow teammates that really want to learn the technologies behind a task a chance to go for it.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Address the issue immediately but tactfully.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Discuss and debate the difference in opinions.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Get used to the different work habits and adapt accordingly is reasonable.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * 1 day outside of class ideally. I think keeping up with Slack otherwise is a good way to keep communication up.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Not necessarily every team member, but at least one if possible, and decisions should be announced publically to the team.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Attempt to find common ground, but move forward with the group decision if necessary.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Communicate the issue with the individual, and work to ensure we move forward as a group.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Start a dialog with the team to address the issue as soon as possible.
