# Sprint 1 - t12 - Team Goslings

## Goal

## A team effort to build a simple web application!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a zip of the repo.
* ~~Version in pom.xml should be `<version>1.0.0</version>`.~~
* ~~Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.~~
* ~~Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.~~
* ~~Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.~~

## Policies

* ~~Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code. ~~
* ~~All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.~~
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* ~~Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.~~
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* ~~All Java dependencies in pom.xml.~~


## Metrics 

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* #1 README.md
* #2 team/eName.md
* #3 Resume
* #4 Distance Calculator

## Daily Scrums

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* ReadMe.md:  *comments*
* team/eName.md
* Resume
* Distance Calculator Core: Got main requirements completed.

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* Distance Calculator (optional) : Ran into issues learning state with React in conjunction with local files, and time management due to classes, work, and unforeseen issues (computers being used as makeshift campfires).

#### What went well
* Coming together as a team to plan out our goals and break down the issues
* Picked up Codepen and JavaScript fairly quickly.
* Good progress towards proper use of GitHub and ZenHub for this sort of project.
* Following GitHub Etiquette well.
* Great team communication.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Difficulty with time mangement for some teammates. Actively resolving moving forward given a better understanding of class and work loads.
* Ran into issues combining code that was written seperately by different team members. Resolved by opening up more communication and working with one another and how each others code works and what is expected.
* Difficulty with react and states. Resolved by doing more research, and sharing findings with teammates.
* Difficulty with codepen during development. Resolved by focing ourselves to use it more and openly asking questions.
* Learning javascript. Resolved by investing more time in studying the language.
