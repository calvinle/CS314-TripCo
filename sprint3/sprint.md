* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | Communication(live) | Getting started sooner | work on intelliJ understanding and stability‚Äù
What we did well | Helping each other when possible | Workflow is good when all are onboard | Codeclimate and Travis are useful, as well as IntelliJ
What we need to work on | Being specific as to what would be worked on | Assigning tasks and being punctual with due dates | Being prepared for IntelliJ being moody
What we will change next time | communicating more specifically about what is happening | Better at PRs, working incrementally often, rather than large amounts of work sporadically | Make sure all intellij stuff is working, use zenhub more effectively for both planning and assessment
